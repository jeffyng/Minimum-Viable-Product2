# Minimum-Viable-Product2
This project will be a waiting list management system. An ideal business that uses it would be a restaurant. Restaurant staff can input the customer's name and phone number into the system. When the tables are almost ready, the staff can send an sms text message to the customer notifying that their tables will be ready soon.
